# Distant Reader Toolbox

Distant Reader Toolbox is a command-line interface for interacting with Distant Reader study carrels.

The Distant Reader (https:/distantreader.org) takes an almost arbitrary amount of unstructured data (text) as input, does text mining and natural language processing against it, and outputs sets of structured data affectionatly called "study carrels".

As you may or may not know, a library study carrel is a little table or room assigned to individual students. The students are then authorized to collect thing from around the library, bring them to their study carrel, organize them in any way they so desire, and persue their research. Distant Reader study carrels are a modern-day version of the venerable library study carrel.

This tool -- rdr -- enables the student, researcher, or scholar to quickly and easily digest the content of carrels to address questions from the mundane to the sublime.
