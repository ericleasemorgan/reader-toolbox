Using the ANSP Network, in addition to aug- menting and speeding up access to current scientific information in all the member institutions, will: • increase the cost-benefit per subscription; • promote the rational use of funds; • ensure continuous subscription to these periodicals; • increase the universe of publications available to users through collection sharing; • guarantee local storage of the information acquired and thus ensure the collection's mainte- nance and its continual use by present and future researchers; and • develop the technical capabilities of the personnel of the state of Sao Paulo institutions in operating and using electronic publication databases.\n",

      "     summary: For decades, technologists have been in the privileged position of having the necessary skills to advance the profession’s digital future, but it will be important for technologists in libraries to integrate the many valuable skills other personnel can offer so that they also can evolve in ways that best support our organizations – leveraging foundational library skills to enhance overall organizational capacity to accomplish tasks that are increasingly requiring technical expertise. Technologists will need to be open to incorporating foundational library skills, to collaborating and learning from other library specialists, to thinking of their positions more broadly, and, for those who live in ivory towers (you know who you are), to eliminating the silos they’ve built and collaborate, cooperate, and engage.\n",

      "     summary: Publishing Linked Bibliographic Metadata The University of Illinois Library worked on publishing MARC21 records of 30,000 digitized books as Linked Library Data by adding links, transforming them to LOD-friendly semantics (MODS) and deploying them as RDF with the objective to be used by a wider community.119 To them, using Semantic Web technologies, a book can be linked to related resources and multiple possible CURRENT STATE OF LINKED AND OPEN DATA IN CATALOGING | ULLAH, KHUSRO, ULLAH, AND NAEEM 60 https://doi.org/10.6017/ital.v37i4.10432 contexts, which is an opportunity for libraries to build innovative user-centered services for the dissemination and uses of bibliographic metadata.120 In this regard, the challenge is to utilize the existing book-related bibliographic maximally and descriptive metadata in a manner that parallels with the services (both inside the library and outside) as well as exploit to the fullest the full-text search and Semantic Web technologies, standards, and LOD services.121 While publishing the National Bibliographic Information as free open Linked Data, IFLA identifies several issues including:122 • dealing with the negative financial impact on the revenue generated from traditional metadata services; • the inability to offer consistent services due to the complexity of copyright and licensing frameworks; • the confusion in understanding the difference between “open” and “free” terms; • remodeling library data as Library Linked Data; • the limited persistence and sustainability of Linked Data resources; • the steep learning curve in understanding and applying Linked Data practices to library data; • making choices between sites to link to; and • creating persistent URIs for library data objects. These challenges include:129 • dealing with the bulky or non-available RDF dumps, no authority control within RDF dumps, and data format variations; • identifying terms’ specificity levels during concept matching; • the limited reusability of Library Linked Data due to lack of contextual data; • harmonizing classes and objects at the institution level; • excessive handcrafting due to few off-the-shelf visualization tools; • manual mapping of vocabularies; • matching, aligning, and disambiguating library and Linked Data; • the limited representation of several essential resources as Linked Data due to non- availability of URIs; • the lack of sufficient representative semantics for bibliographic data; • the time-consuming nature of Linked Data to understand its structure for reuse; • the ambiguity of terms across languages; and • the non-stability of endpoints and outdated datasets.\n",

      "     summary: When designing the data warehouse, the authors started from the requirements of the end users (demand -driven approach) and extracted data from heterogeneous sources.14 A similar approach has been used by Yang and Shieh, who started from the reports needed by public libraries in Taiwan and through an iterative methodological approach modeled a data warehouse that meets all their reporting requirements.15 Unlike the previously described articles where a demand-driven approach was used, we applied a hybrid approach to modeling data warehouse. There are several approaches to modeling data warehouse and we followed a hybrid approach to design dimensional models presented in this article.\n",

It is essential for librarians to understand the mechanism of IS project management in order to successfully bring technology innovation to the organization.\n",

If Gold OA refers to complete open access at the time of publication, and Green OA refers to articles published in a paywalled journal but ultimately made OA either after an embargo period or via an IR, Bronze OA refers to OA articles that somehow don’t fit into either of these categories.\n",

General Search Studies and Single Search Boxes Many advantages and disadvantages have been ascribed to tools with single search boxes (whether federated search tools or discovery layers), namely ease and convenience on the one hand, and the lack of precision possible in searching and overwhelming number of results on the other.\n",

      "     summary: In libraries, information systems are widely used to provide services to patrons, however, there is little known about information security practices in libraries.9 Given the sensitivity of the data libraries handle, and the lack of information security resources available to them, it is important for those currently or planning to work in the library environment to develop the knowledge necessary to identify risks and develop and employ risk mitigation strategies to protect information and information resources they are entrusted with. Therefore, the research question in this present study is: How can cybersecurity education strengthen information security practices in libraries?\n",

Willard Marriott Library has a long-running digital library program and a burgeoning digital scholarship center creating a moment of synergy for librarians in digital collections and digital scholarship to explore collaboration in teaching, outreach, and digital collection development. “Collections as data” is a growing movement to extend the research value of digital collections beyond traditional use and to give researchers more flexible access to our collections by facilitating access to the underlying data, thereby enabling digital humanities research.1 Collections as data is predicated upon the convergence of two scholarly trends happening in parallel over the past several decades.2 First, as mentioned above, librarians and archivists have digitized a significant portion of their special collections, giving access to unique material that researchers previously had to travel across the country or globe to study.\n",

      "     summary: Although using books held by a set of libraries at a given time as the corpus has its own problems of unrepresentativeness—particularly, for long-established libraries, the fact that the books on the shelf at a given time represent not only works of interest to current users but also those of interest to users from decades past—triangulating this data with that provided by the Google Books Ngram data would at least give some sense of whether and where these different corpora disagree.4 Creating corpora using books that are known to have been owned by a given library at a given point in time is potentially feasible because digitized records of the books in several hundred nineteenth-century library collections are available in the form of scanned book catalogs: a book or pamphlet listing all of the books available in a particular library. By the end of the nineteenth century, book catalogs had largely been replaced by the card catalog system that remained in use through most of the twentieth century.\n",

      "     summary: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES DECEMBER 2021 DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION STATEMENTS ON ACADEMIC LIBRARY WEBSITES | ELY 2 LITERATURE REVIEW Literature regarding DEI in academic libraries is plentiful.4 In addition to abundant scholarly research, the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) addressed diversity via the “Diversity Standards: Cultural Competency for Academic Libraries,” while equity, diversity and inclusion are part of ACRL’s timeless core ideology.5 The Association of Research Libraries (ARL) has similarly addressed diversity via the SPEC Kit 356: Diversity and Inclusion, which compiled information regarding recruitment and retention of minority librarians, strategies for fostering inclusive workplaces, and diversity programs and assessment.6 Additionally, the American Library Association (ALA) announced the formation of a joint task force to create a framework for cultural proficiencies in racial equity.7 Despite ample research and professional attention to DEI, surprisingly, no studies have explicitly examined academic library DEI statements and few studies have examined diversity content on library websites. Wadas’ analysis also identified a prevailing sense of vagueness across college/university and academic library mission statements, further contributing to confusion regarding statements’ purpose and intended messages.11 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND LIBRARIES DECEMBER 2021 DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION STATEMENTS ON ACADEMIC LIBRARY WEBSITES | ELY 3 Mission Statements, Strategic Plans and Diversity: Content Analyses Wilson, Meyer, and McNeal examined institutional mission statements and other diversity-related content on 80 websites of institutions of higher education in the United States.12 Fifty-nine (75%) referenced diversity in their mission statements and 52 (65%) had a separate diversity statement.\n",

Some of the library’s current information and communications technology (ICT)- based services include digital repository services for the Institution’s research publications and theses and dissertations, a faculty profiling system, a web-based online public access catalogue (Web OPAC), and Shibboleth-based federated access to the library’s subscribed online resources.\n",

Data availability relates to the replication technique the Amazon infrastructure uses.10 There also are solutions that take advantage of public cloud storage using replication techniques based on RAID, for example Redundant Array of Cloud Storage (RACS), a proxy located between multiple cloud storage providers and customers.11 RACS distributes data in a way that provides an opportunity for clients to tolerate interruptions in a public cloud storage service or when the price for using such services gets too high.\n",

Fair use, a statutory exception to U.S. copyright law, is a complex subject, but a brief examination of the principle gets to the heart of copyright law itself.\n",

      "     summary: The MARC plugin requires the encoding of the source MARC files to be UTF-8, whereas the records are exported from the ILS with MARC-8 encoding. The only published report on batch importing into the EPrints platform describes Perl scripts for metadata-only records import from Thomson Reuters Reference Manager.6 Bulk importing is often one of the first tasks after launching a repository, so it is unsurprising that requests for reports and documentation on EPrints-specific workflow have been a recurring question on the EPrints Tech List.7 A recently published review of EPrints identifies “the absence of a bulk uploading feature” as its most significant weakness.8 Although EPrints’ graphical user interface for bulk importing is limited to the use of the installed import plugins, the software does have a versatile infrastructure for this purpose.\n",

      "     summary: This is an acknowledgment of current resource limitations relative to the burgeon- ing quantities of digital content that need to be preserved. However, a short survey of some of the leading efforts clarifies for even the casual observer that implementation of the proposed standards is beyond many of those who are creating or hosting digital content, particularly because of restrictions on acceptable formats, requirements for extensive metadata in specific XML encodings, need for programmers for implementation, costs for participation, or simply a lack of a clear set of steps for the unini- tiated to follow (examples include: Planets, PREMIS, DCC, CASPAR, iRods, Sound Directions, HathiTrust).1 The deluge of digital content coupled with the lack of funding for digital preservation and exacerbated by the expanding variety of formats, makes the application of extensive standards and extraordinary techniques beyond the reach of the majority.\n",

      "     summary: Because of the difficulty of selecting words to represent visual/aural sym- bolism, subject indexing for art and cultural objects is usually guided by Panofsky’s three levels of meaning (pre-iconographical, iconographical, and post-iconographical), further refined by Layne in “ofness” and “aboutness” in each level. These may include generic terms that describe the work and the elements that it comprises, terms that identify particular people, geographic places, narrative and icono- graphic themes, or terms that refer to broader concepts or interpretations.5 Seeing the Wood for the Trees: Enhancing Metadata Subject Elements with Weights Subject indexing has been conducted in a dichotomous way in terms of what the information object is primar- ily about/of or not, corresponding to the presence or absence of a particular subject term, respectively.\n",

      "     summary: This month’s issue takes some of these themes further, with articles that examine the usability of autocompletion features in library search interfaces (Ward, Hahn, and Feist), reveal patterns of student use of library computers (Thompson), propose a cloud-based digital library storage solution (Sosa-Sosa), and summarize attributes of open standard file formats (Park, Oh). The first volume of JOLA offers a fascinating glimpse into early days of library automation, when many things were different, such as the size (big) and capacity (small) of computer hardware, and many things were the same (e.g., Richard Johnson’s description of the book catalog project at Stanford, where “the major achievement of the preliminary systems design was to establish a meaningful dialogue between the librarian and systems and computer personnel.”\n",

      "     summary: Still, given our eagerness to discuss how we extend the reach of “screens” in libraries—whether in the form of learning commons, wireless access, mobile-friendly web- sites, clearing stacks of “tree-books” in favor of e-books, etc.—would it not be reasonable to think that we should show as much concern about the consequences of such activities, and even some interest in providing possible remedial alternatives? (14–15) Drawing inspiration and analogy from a list of philos- ophers and other historical and literary figures beginning with Plato and ending with McLuhan, Powers describes seven practical approaches, tools, and techniques for dis- connecting from our screen-driven life: ■■ Seek physical distance (Plato) ■■ Seek intellectual and emotional distance (Seneca) ■■ Hope for devices that might allow us to customize our degree of connectedness (Gutenberg) ■■ Consider older, low-tech tools as alternatives where possible (Shakespeare via Hamlet) ■■ Create positive rituals (Ben Franklin) ■■ Create a “Walden zone” refuge (Thoreau) ■■ Be aware of and take personal control from technol- ogy by being aware of that technology (McLuhan) Powers then reviews how he and his family used these techniques to regain the sense of control and depth they felt they’d lost to screens.\n",

      "     summary: despite heroic efforts on the part of librarians, students seldom have sufficiently sustained exposure to and practice with library skills to reach the point where they feel real ease with and mastery of library information systems.2 According to the final report of Bibliographic Services Task Force of the University of California Libraries, users expect the following: ■■ one system or search to cover a wide information universe (e.g., Google or Amazon) ■■ enriched metadata (e.g., ONIX, tables of contents, and cover art) ■■ full-text availability ■■ to move easily and seamlessly from a citation about an item to the item itself—discovery alone is not enough ■■ systems to provide a lot of intelligent assistance ■❏ correction of obvious spelling errors ■❏ results sorting in order of relevance to their queries ■❏ help in navigating large retrievals through logi- cal subsetting or topical maps or hierarchies ■❏ help in selecting the best source through rel- evance ranking or added commentary from peers and experts or “others who used this also used that” tools ■❏ customization and personalization services ■■ authenticated single sign-on ■■ security and privacy ■■ communication and collaboration ■■ multiple formats available: e-books, MPEG, JPEG, RSS and other push technologies, along with tradi- tional, tangible formats ■■ direct links to e-mail, instant messaging, and sharing ■■ access to online virtual communities ■■ access to what the library has to offer without actu- ally having to visit the library3 Bradford lee eden (eden@library.ucsb.edu) is Associate Uni- versity Librarian for Technical Services & Scholarly Communica- tion, University of California, Santa Barbara. Budgets are stagnant, staffing is at an all-time low, new information formats continue to appear and require attention, and users are no longer patient nor comfortable working with our clunky OPACs.8 Why do libraries continue to support an infrastructure of buying and offering the same books, CDs, DVDs, journals, etc., at every library, when the new information environment offers libraries the opportu- nity to showcase and present their unique information resources and one-of-a-kind collections to the world?\n",

Internet users actively participat- ing in and shaping the online communities are, perhaps unintentionally, influencing how those who access infor- mation via the Internet expect to be able to receive and use digital resources.\n",

      "     summary: Chris Wood of Sun gave a presentation at the 2008 PASIG Spring Meeting in which he estimated that the cost to supply power and cooling alone to maintain a peta- byte (1,000 TB) of disk-based digital content for a mere ten years would easily exceed $1 million.1 Refining his figures downward somewhat, Wood noted a few months later at the following PASIG meeting that for a 1 TB drive, the five- year estimated power and cooling for 2008–12 could be estimated at approximately $320, or $640,000 per petabyte over ten years, still a considerable sum.2 Add to this the costs of migration—consider that a modern spinning disk is generally thought to have a use- ful lifespan of about five years, and tape may have two or three decades—and the need regular integrity-checking of digital content for “bit-rot,” and you have the stuff of a sustainability nightmare. Can we meaningfully plan for the preservation of digital content over centuries given our poor track record over just the past few decades?\n",

The results of the analysis suggest that the next- generation ILS could have substantial implications for library systems and technical staffing models in particular, suggesting that library staffing models could be redesigned and key librarian and staff positions redefined to meet the opportunities and challenges brought on by the next-generation ILS.\n",

Thus embracing Library 2.0 potentially threatens the traditional ethics of librarianship, where protecting patron privacy and intellectual freedom has been held paramount.\n",

A number of libraries across the country have been actively expanding makerspace within the physical library and exploring its impact; as head of one such library, I can report that reactions to the associated changes have been quite polarized.\n",

      "     summary: T. This has two major disadvantages: 1) the overlap cannot be increased independently of the number of loose documents; increasing the overlap by lowering T in general decreases the percentage of loose documents; 2) the difference between d.'s highest score and d/s second highest score is ignored; e.g., if T=50, g(ct,P~)=200, and g(ct,P2)=50, then ct is assigned to both sl and s2. The first problem decreases the flexibility of the algorithm, since the amount of overlap and percentage of loose documents cannot be varied independently.\n",

The implementation of virtual and bulk-tagging facilities over Solr information spaces is a challenge, since bulk updates of Solr objects are fast, but far from being real-time when large sets of objects are involved.\n",

Peter Lewis, in MARC and the Future in Libraries, makes the point that whereas BNB cards provided a ready-made product for libraries, MARC tapes will merely offer them a set of parts to put together themselves.\n",

The authors of this study pointed out that self-paced instruction, lab time, office, hours, and email exchange were all factors that are affecting web-based multimedia (WBMM) Flash that were incorporated into instruction.29 Rather than focusing purely on the content of online library instruction tutorials, some studies considered and evaluated the various tutorial-creating software tools.\n",

The ability to prioritize tasks and identify mission-critical features of mobile MAMW are some of the most common activities undertaken by libraries to manage this scope.32 For instance, it is not practical to make entire library websites mobile because libraries would end up serving only those patrons who access their sites over mobile alone.\n",

We will discuss each technique in tum, and then suggest an elabora- tion of the search key technique that incorporates some features of the Boolean search technique; this combination of techniques should enable systems that are committed to the use of search keys as a primary access route to extend this technique to large files.\n",

They rely on relevance ranking and are often reluctant to examine search results in any depth: if the desired item does not appear within the first few hits, users tend to rework their initial search statement (often with only a minimal change to the search terms) rather than scrolling down to the bottom of the results screen or looking beyond the first page of results.\n",

      "     summary: Underpinning the proposal was a 2015 paper from the Max Planck Digital Library that suggested that the amount of money currently being spent (largely by libraries) on journal subscriptions should be sufficient to fund research publication costs if applied to a “flipped” journal publishing business model, from subscription-based to gold open access.1 In the Netherlands, the university sector has adopted a national approach in negotiating deals with several major publishers (Springer, SAGE, Elsevier, and Wiley) that allow Dutch authors to publish their papers as gold OA, without additional charges (but, depending on the publisher, with limits on total numbers and/or which journals are available within the deals).2 The so-called “Dutch Deal” by the VSNU (Association of universities in the Netherlands) and UKB (Dutch Consortium of University Libraries and Royal Library) takes a national approach to flipping the model, attempting to bundle access rights for Dutch readers with APC credits for Dutch authors. From the point of view of a university librarian, focused on keeping journal subscription costs in line (unsuccessfully I might add), I think there is real danger in not considering what a flip to a gold model might look like.\n",

Thus, the majority of CRL makerspaces in New England depended primarily on contributions from friends of the library, university/college alumni, and donors.\n",
