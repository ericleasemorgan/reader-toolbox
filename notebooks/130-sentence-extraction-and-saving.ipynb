Each grammar is made up words, and each word can be denoted as a certain part-of-speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.). Given a sentence, parts-of-speach values can be assigned to each word. It is then possible to determine whether or not a setence includes a grammar, and if it does, the do some other sort of processing.\n",
