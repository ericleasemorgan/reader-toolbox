    "The Distant Reader and the Distant Reader Toolbox create and report on collections of narrative text, and therefore study carrel content is bibliographic in nature. Content can be described using authors, titles, and dates. Other descriptive (metadata) elements include summaries, statistically significant keywords, extents, and locations. Combined, all of these elements are a kin to bibliography. This notebook introduces how to learn about the contents of your carrel through bibliographics.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Nota bene.* Bibliographic elements such as summaries, keywords, extents, and locations are computed, and therefore always have values. On the other hand, authors, titles, and dates need to be extracted from the original documents. The extraction process is problematic since author, title, and date values may not exist, and if they do, then they are manifested in so many ways that extracting them is a world of pain. The Toolbox does its best in this regard. If you had to list the authors, titles, and dates of about 160 PDF files, then you would be challenged too. Alternatively, when a carrel is built, author, title, and date values can optionally be stated explicitly. Thus, authors, titles and date values do not always exist, but the other values do. With this in mind, this notebook reads a carrel named 'ital-2006-2010', which is complete with author, title, and date values. This carrel includes about 160 PDF files on the topic of computers and libraries."

Since the early days of the Internet, I've been continually struck by the incredible opportunities library profession has been slow to open up access to the publications of its own professional association, and you have to push through plans to realign its finances, organizational mission, and goals in the new world of networked information. So, as a long-time LITA member, I find it a great pleasure to see LITA finally reach this milestone with Information Technology and Libraries (ITAL) moving to fully open-access electronic distribution, and I congratulate the LITA leadership for the educational settings, and to further the interactions between librarians, information scientists, open-access journals. Supporting ITAL as an open-access journal is a very good reason indeed to be a member of LITA.

Since the early days of the Internet, I've been continually struck by the incredible opportunities library profession has been slow to open up access to the publications of its own professional association, and you have to push through plans to realign its finances, organizational mission, and goals in the new world of networked information. So, as a long-time LITA member, I find it a great pleasure to see LITA finally reach this milestone with Information Technology and Libraries (ITAL) moving to fully open-access electronic distribution, and I congratulate the LITA leadership for the educational settings, and to further the interactions between librarians, information scientists, open-access journals.
