More to come
============

Here ends this first version of the Distant Reader Toolbox documentation, but there is more to come. For example, additions will include:

1. Acknowledgements - the Toolbox stands on the shoulders of giants, and this section will enumerate those good works

2. Additional functionality - Ngrams, concordances, and rudimentary grammars only scratch the surface of study carrel functionality, and other things will include: parts-of-speech analysis, named-entity extraction, geolocation, full text search, semantic indexing, advanced topic modeling, etc. 

3. Tutorials - these items will be akin to case studies, for example, we might answer the questions, "Who was Hector?", "How do Augustine's and Rousseau's definitions of love compare and contrast?", or "When it comes to COVID, what is mRNA?"

4. Appendices - this section will include things like tips and tricks, how to install things like Lynx, how to better configure the use of the Natural Langauge Toolkit, etc.
