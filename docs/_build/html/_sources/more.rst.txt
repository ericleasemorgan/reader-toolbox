More to come
============

Here ends this first version of the Distant Reader Toolbox documentation, but there is more to come. For example, additions will include:

1. Tutorials - these items will be akin to case studies, for example, we might answer the questions, "Who was Hector?", "How do Augustine's and Rousseau's definitions of love compare and contrast?", or "When it comes to COVID, what is mRNA?"

2. Appendices - this section will include things like tips and tricks, how to install things like Lynx, how to better configure the use of the Natural Langauge Toolkit, etc.
