Use case: Network graphs
========================

Collocating texts and visualizing them as a network graph is a more advanced form of concordancing. The resulting model is a good way to learn how words are used in context with other words. After all, "You shall know a word by the company it keeps." This use case outlines one way to apply collocations to Homer and illustrate the results with an application called Gephi. The same process can be applied to just about any carrel.

Collocation is a process of enumerating bigrams where each word is inside a window of words to the left and to the right of the given word.
