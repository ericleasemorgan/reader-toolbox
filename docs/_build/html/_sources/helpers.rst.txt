  3. htid2books_ - Given an access key, secret token, and a HathiTrust identifier, this set of Bash/Perl scripts output plain text as well as PDF versions of a book.
  4. mbox2reader_ - Given a few configurations, this Python script read an mbox file, and outputs a file system amenable to the Reader
  5. OpenRefine_ - A wonderful, GUI, cross-platform tool for reading, normalizing, and analyzing tabular data; takes practice but pays off in the end
  6. txt2chapters_ - Given a plain text file, a pattern, and a directory, this Perl script subdivides the file into chapters saved in the directory
