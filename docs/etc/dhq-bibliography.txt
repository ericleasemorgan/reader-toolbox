       title: Philosophy and Digital Humanities: A review of Willard McCarty, Humanities Computing (London and NY: Palgrave, 2005)

     summary: McCarty’s unique contribution here is the singularity of his focus on digital humanities as an epistemological undertaking. The history of knowledge in which McCarty wants to place digital humanities is scientific rather than literary in its cultural affiliation, more in the lineage of philosophy of science ( Thomas Kuhn, Kurt Gödel, and Hans Gadamer) than that of poets and literary philosophers ( Mikhail Bahktin, Alfred Jarry, Francesco Varela, or Roland Barthes).

     summary: Stronger connections between the literary history of quest narratives and quest games can also offer strategies for how to teach a rich tradition of literature through technologies associated with a more recent but equally valuable selection of games, from early adventure games of the 1980’s to next-generation RPG’s. Susana Tosca observes the relevance of the genres of epic and romance as well as Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey to the background of quest games though she brackets the question of how closely the literary and gaming traditions can be related, arguing primarily that such theories are not pointless to the study of games .

     summary: Only historians can provide this overlooked user group with the additional resources that they need to perceive and enjoy historical source materials. It began in 1998 as a partnership in which a number of Illinois institutions, including museums, archives, and research and academic libraries, sought to share historical materials with the public.

     summary: Thus if we were to understand Tibetan texts according to a theoretical and operational paradigm that treats them only as information, we would not only lose the original Tibetan cultural context but would lose the different degrees of transmission power said to be generated by different media (reading, chanting, lung transmission, etc.) within the Tibetan textual tradition. This representation of the enunciative mode, which is essential to practicing with Tibetan texts, might be accomplished by additional, customized TEI elements for the chanted sections of the texts.

     summary: Recent efforts to reconceptualize text analysis with computers in order to broaden the appeal of humanities computing have invoked the example of the Oulipo. The potentiality of computers as tools for text analysis implies that scholars engaged in the derivative activity of interpreting literature may not find such methods useful.

     summary: As we are a magazine that not only receives authors who are trained in the use of digital tools, but also tries to show the advantages of digital editing, even to those writers who aren’t familiar with the digital media, one of our challenges has been to explain to authors how they can expose their ideas in order to be published by the magazine’s developers. From Text to Digital Revision In the beginning, like many other digital magazines, the Revista Digital Universitaria tried to simulate a paper magazine, using the screen as if it was a sheet of paper, and using the home page as a magazine cover ( http://www.revista.unam.mx/indexabr01.html).

     summary: We also worked technologically, through the incorporation of a database specifically designed to allow HHC students to see each others’ works, to make peer review a regular part of their academic experience, and to require them to comprehend and use metadata. Beyond the disciplinary courses and interdisciplinary courses, the latter of which were such as Visions of Heaven and Hell (Classics and English), Aspects of the Mediaeval World (English and Philosophy), and Colonial and Postcolonial Africa (English and History), we envisioned a course that would form the core of the educational experience for HHC students, and it is to this course we will now turn your attention.

     summary: The application interface had to be constructed in such a way that it would be relatively easy for observers to link visual icons from a restricted but varied set to the digital objects in the collection.

     summary: Ultimately, the increased distribution of Greco-Roman cultural materials into many other languages will speed the complementary process of opening up materials in classical Chinese, Arabic, Sanskrit and other languages to speakers of English and other European languages. An individual Latinist, Johann Ramminger, had accumulated a wordlist of later Latin from Petarch up through 1700 that was based on 200,000,000 words of text already available in digital form.

     summary: Properly understood, an essay written for such an assignment constitutes a moment in a conversation, in which the student interprets primary sources, understood through the lens of previous scholarship, and makes a statement to the teacher and sometimes to fellow students as well. Are we to assume that our knowledge of both the Greek rites of the Thesmophorion and the Roman festival of the Bona Dea stands on a mere handful of primary sources?

     summary: Although the range of relevant references may be quite broad, nonetheless annotating a Suda entry for SOL is very much the same kind of work as writing commentary notes for any other classical text: one identifies quotations and allusions, glosses difficult grammar or obscure words, and perhaps mentions similar passages in other works. At present, some 3/4 of translated entries have low vetting status.

     summary: As other digital scholarly editions have noted (e.g., the Cervantes Project, see ), providing users access to these rare and normally inaccessible manuscripts or other texts is an important goal for the project in and of itself. As Gregory Nagy has demonstrated, Aristarchus had available to him at the library of Ptolemaic Alexandria a great number of Homeric texts (see especially ).

     summary: For example, KML and GeoRSS-tagged web feeds can now be posted and managed just like other basic web content. Many of them are also breaking down traditional divisions between browse and search, thematic layers, web content, spatial processing and geographic datasets, not least through the mechanisms known generically as mashups (web applications that dynamically combine data and services from multiple, other web applications to provide a customized service or data product).

       words: 8622
      flesch: 66
     summary: Generations of Latin students have learned that each verb in Latin has four principal parts (present indicative active first person singular, active infinitive, perfect indicative active first person singular, perfect passive participle (neuter nominative singular)). For instance, conjugations cIIb and cIIe are distinguished by e37, which is perfect indicative active first person singular.

Our approach is to use already established methods in natural language processing; as such, our methodology involves the application of three core technologies: identifying word senses from parallel texts; locating the correct sense for a word using contextual information; and parsing a text to extract important syntactic information.

     summary: In a digital world, however, we can begin to address this ancient critique: manually edited hyperlinks and search engines are only initial instruments by which readers can make digital texts less opaque than their print counterparts. Thus, readers without training in Arabic but familiar with other languages and with the underlying scientific contexts can use automated morphological analyses, links to an on-line dictionary, and existing translations in languages that they do understand to pull apart Arabic source texts and determine which words are used in particular contexts to describe key concepts.

     summary: We did win awards to record the African American data and to conduct new kinds of research (e.g., NSF awards to explore neural-network analysis of Atlas data, and to conduct a pilot project for random-sample survey research in Atlanta), and some of these resources were applied to computer work, but no award specifically funded our Web innovations. Development of our Web site was primarily accomplished by two graduate assistants, Rafal Konopka and Eric Rochester, who worked on Atlas computer projects for twelve years between them, first Konopka through our initial Web implementation, then Rochester through the first major revision.

     summary: Just as software projects typically put out numbered releases, which provide the triumphant moment of celebration while suggesting that more is yet to come, designing projects to incorporate such incrementalism by way of staged releases that mark phases of accomplishment or a number of discrete and in some way publishable deliverables, seems a particularly useful way to structure digital projects. But it helps conceive more appropriately what done might mean for a lot of digital projects, with their capacity to increment and to migrate both technologically and with their field, just as does the analogy of the library for the Perseus Project.

     summary: It is found that female authors use personal pronouns and negative polarity items at a much higher rate than their male counterparts, and male authors demonstrate a strong preference for determiners and numerical quantifiers. Male authors, for example, use religious terminology rooted in the church, while female authors use secular language to discuss spirituality.

     summary: Attention is performative and situational; as such, we make the argument that designing and implementing new choreographies of attention should be central to building sustainable models for knowledge production and dissemination in the contemporary academy. Interacting with personal screens during a lecture or other live event has become commonplace and, as a result, the economy of attention that defines these situations has changed.

     summary: Much of what has happened in the field of digital textual studies has happened in localized environments, supported by innovators like McGann who took advantage of reputations developed in print work to advocate for digital work, convincing recalcitrant disciplines and colleagues to support and accept experimentation in the digital, and urging us to see the necessity of continued engagement on the part of humanities scholars in the remediation of our cultural heritage. The posters included in this issue shift our attention away from the history, theory, and intellectual positioning of digital textual studies to speak instead to the engagement of textual studies with emergent trends in digital humanities, including mapping, visualization, recovery and more.

     summary: Using what was then the latest draft of the core code of JPEG 2000 and assembling a group of problematic Blake images, he devised a system that separated each image into its elements, processed the tone and color with JPEG 2000 and its edges with MRC (Multi-Raster Content) technology — developed by Xerox for sophisticated processing of graphic elements in fax documents — and then recombined the result for display in a JPEG 2000 viewer plug-in ; ; . Despite evident progress in devising sturdy and responsive standards, images, and tools, stubborn problems persist in several key areas that are explored here through an overview of issues that arise as the William Blake Archive acquires images, prepares them for reproduction, and makes them available for manipulation by its users.

     summary: Like most digital editing endeavors, the Walt Whitman Archive must proceed with an awareness of the print past — in our case, especially of two significant attempts to present Whitman in scholarly editions: The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman (G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1902) and The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman (New York University Press, Peter Lang, and the University of Iowa Press, 1961-2004). If the Walt Whitman Archive resembles a database (without meeting the specifications of a technical or a literal definition), so, too, does Whitman’s own process of composition.

     summary: Together the two essays examine the nature of the print things that textual scholarship tries to identify and analyse, in order to see how best to represent them in electronic scholarly editions and archives. But second, and perhaps just as important, public policy governing the funding of textual scholarship projects is driven by forces that fail to address the fact that a fully functional and generalizable environment within which to mount electronic scholarly editions has yet to be developed.

     summary: The process of developing such an interface has led to the articulation of a set of axioms that have guided my work: Seek tight coordination in the display of text and facsimile image Incorporate visual cueing to guide/reinforce reader attention Provide unobtrusive, but handy, analytical tools Promote ease of navigation – build in linkages that are likely to answer and/or provoke a reader’s curiosity Work in one visual space for text and images – no windows or frames, no scrolling when possible Supply information at likely points of need – avoid overload, expose what the text knows selectively Keep decoration to a minimum: no chrome, don’t frame the view, don’t let the tools distract or overwhelm. In addition to demonstrating programs designed to display documentary and critical editions of Piers Plowman (which serves as the locus for all examples shown), the poster describes programs written to permit electronic markup of facsimile images of the medieval manuscripts as well as programs that assist editors in the TEI-compliant markup of documentary and critical texts.

Both schools, upon noticing that the new medium of video games has elements of past media — games or narrative — proceed without paying adequate attention to any aspects of the medium that do not contribute to this similarity.

     summary: But these are remarkable precisely because they are exceptions, and the recent report from Ithaka ( University Publishing in a Digital Age) makes it clear that university presses are losing mind-share with their campus-level administrators, and losing the initiative to university libraries: In our interviews we detected significant detachment from administrators about publishing's connection to their core mission; a high level of energy and excitement from librarians about reinventing their roles on campus to meet the evolving needs of their constituents; and a wide range of responses from press directors, from those who are continuing to do what they have always done, to those who are actively reconnecting with their host institutions’ academic programs and engaging in collaborative efforts to develop new electronic products. A more recent response, by Sandy Thatcher, director of Penn State's Press, repeats the complaint that the ACLS Commission's report is uninformed and unrealistic with respect to the harsh economic realities of university press and scholarly society publishing:

     summary: We have found that a massive range of technologies are used in e-Science projects: frequently, all these have in common is that they share the somewhat loose label of advanced networking technologies. He has published on topics in e-science generally, on e-science methods in archaeology, and in the fields of Minoan environmental archaeology and geospatial archaeological computing.

      flesch: 42
     summary: The field is expanding and at the same time being negotiated, and this article explores the idea of a broadly conceived landscape of digital humanities in some depth. The study starts out from typologies of digital humanities, a flythrough of the landscape, and a discussion of what being a digital humanist entails.

        date: 2010-07-20
       words: 6129
      flesch: 62
     summary: In sum, unlike in contemporary hypertext systems like the web, FRESS provided a variety of coordinated views and conditional structure and view-specification mechanisms. One of the reasons why the web does not have the same functionality as earlier hypertext systems such as FRESS or NLS is that a URL points to a document: unless the author pre-specifies anchors in the target page, there is no finer granularity than that.

      flesch: 49
     summary: Applied to our case, that is, the representation and use of digital text, this vision of time, open to history, forces us to acknowledge that the actual computational models, and in particular formal languages like XML, are not always adequate for the representation of unstable cultural information structures such as textual variants; rethink the models of digital documents, incorporating the vision of text as a process, a plastic phenomenon, part of a temporal continuum in which all of its phases and structures (material or abstract The phases of the process of writing are abstract and can be reproduced via digital simulations; but the structures of a document (the product) can be either material or abstract: the trace left on the page is a material fact, but the insertion of a title, the start of a new paragraph, the insertion of a note etc. exist as categories and as models which from time to time take concrete form in situations and expressions. As already mentioned, markup languages appear to be — at the moment — the most flexible scientific and economical solution for the representation of digital text.

     summary: While the purpose and direction of tools and tool development for the Digital Humanities have been debated in various forums, the value of tool development as a scholarly activity has seen little discussion. Survey results indicate that tool development is indeed considered a scholarly activity by developers, but recognition of this work and rewards for it lag behind rewards for traditional scholarly pursuits (such as journal articles and book publication).

      flesch: 33
     summary: In Expressive Processing, Noah Wardrip-Fruin makes a compelling case that software studies as a field is not only an interesting avenue of research for new media specialists but also should increasingly be a basic activity of educated citizens in a 21st century democracy. On one hand, games of the sort Wardrip-Fruin examines are a medium for storytelling and character creation, and as such are natural extensions of the work of previous literary and media studies scholars and thereby set up a convenient space for humanities scholars and teachers to consider the important cultural and technical issues raised by Wardrip-Fruin in an environment more familiar than, for instance, an analysis of the software that drives Walmart (one of Wardrip-Fruin’s suggestions for another work of software studies scholarship).

     summary: The study of transmissive variation in electronic objects — greatly facilitated by the self-documenting nature of electronic media — brings textual studies into the field of digital media. By recontextualizing digital media works and media theory in wider social and cultural phenomena, we can see how certain practices get their content and forms from other fields (in this instance gendered practices and discourses) at the same time that they are transformed by the electronic capabilities of synchronous and constant communication.

     summary: During its lifecycle, the project engaged other national and international initiatives relevant to Van Gogh studies by opening up its development to an interdisciplinary framework, establishing cooperative efforts of various kinds (between individuals and, more importantly across institutions at the international level, from museums, galleries and auction houses to libraries and archives), and using lessons learned through past endeavours. It encompasses more than two thousand pages in six heavy volumes of translucent paper, the first five of which include the corpus of translated letters where each main text section is beautifully laid out in one or two columns and accompanied by editorial side notes, relevant small illustrations (art works in the form of paintings and etchings that Van Gogh mentions in his correspondence or that the editors imply are referred to by the Dutch author), and some facsimiles of the letters in full page (generally only when a sketch by the artist occurs).

The political and aesthetic efficacy of collective novels lay in their ability to generate cognitive maps, making both connection and, just as important, disconnection visible.

By providing access Google seems to be the corpus of reference while remaining a protean manifold of processes that continually reconfigure themselves while crawling over our networked body of language (the actual corpus), even unto the edge of chaos, finding new readable things and indexing them relentlessly and swiftly, remarkably swiftly.

     summary: The entanglement of the digital humanities with the commercial and governmental worlds symbolised by DARPA and IBM is connected to the fact that digital systems (at both a hardware and software level) are engineered. As digital humanities projects grow in size and complexity university programs will need to adapt, balancing the needs of technological systems with the imperatives of the humanities tradition.

     summary: There is evidence for both and perhaps some combination of these two types of reading machines. The visual punctuation suggests the 3-D sculptural apparatus involved in reading and a precursor to future reading machines — perhaps not hand-held, but spatial, sculptural and dependent on the place for the reader's body.

What makes this work significant for the concerns about media life is how it reminds us of the ways in which media activities and practices can only be understood in a broad context that includes both material and spatial considerations, reflecting a nuanced take on how the social arrangements of media both stretch existing ways of doing things and making sense of the world across cultural and spatial boundaries, while at the same time functioning to articulate and demarcate local communities and identities.

The researchers identified resources of which scholars report use, but limited to resources containing born-digital content by and for a scholarly audience, among which E-only journals, preprints, blogs and discussion forums; social tools for the general public like Facebook or Diigo were excluded.

     summary: Envisioning the Digital Humanities Introduction At the end of November 2010, at a contemporary moment when many feel that the Humanities are under threat, digital humanities is serving as a means to advocate and rethink the Humanities. In the first article, I examined the discursive transition from humanities computing to digital humanities, analyzing how this naming is related to shifts in institutional, disciplinary, and social organization.

     summary: This article identifies some of the popular and historical contradictions inherent to the very notion of close reading digital literature, and puts forth an updated conception of what the author argues continues to be a vital practice of literary study. The author applies the updated conception of close reading digital literature to Steve Tomasula's TOC , a self-described new media novel.

     summary: Implicit in those conversations was the suggestion that the institutionalized book burning in 451 had an analog in the virtuality Kindle books occupy: thanks to that association, the Kindle’s naming acquired a graphic ideological tenor, one made excessive by virtue of the material act described. Readers who reveled in the prospect of downloading canonicity at little cost — most of Austen’s novels, for instance, are available for free as Kindle books — faced the disdain of those who not only expressed a preference for print but insisted, in a way Bourdieu would recognize, that it is the rightful medium for the reading, say, of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night.

     summary: The introduction of Web 2.0 principles and practices and the development of social media networks in the late 1990s and early 21st century marked a definitive shift in the elemental foundations of digital media culture. In this analysis, I track a historical context for considering the relationship between organic bodies and digital intervention and illustrate ways in which the human body currently operates as an expressive referent within social media networks.

     summary: As Cathy Davidson of Duke University and co-founded of the Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC) explains, The first generation of digital humanities was all about data. The excitement and impetus of digital humanities throughout much of the 1990s and continuing to the present was that massive data bases could be digitised, searched, and combined with other data bases for interoperable searches that yielded more complex and complete results in a shorter amount of time than the human mind has ever imagined possible.

     summary: In Erewhon (1872), Samuel Butler provides the first description of how machines reproduce by means of human agency. This diffraction or gearing down of human agency into lower machinic levels is represented as initially violent and destructive, in keeping both with the violence of Sobol's first-person shooter games and the literary genre of techno-thriller fiction.

     summary: A central question is the level of formal training that digital humanities scholars had in computing up to the mid-1980s and how this has shaped their understanding of what digital humanities is and is not. I spent time with Ian Lancashire and many of his colleagues, Russ Wooldridge and others at that power house where Willard McCarty was as well, that is the University of Toronto Centre for Computing in the Humanities (CCH); from there I spent time at a couple of different institutions, including Oxford, where I got to know Lou Burnard and the folks at OUCS, University of British Columbia, where I ultimately completed my degree working with a number of digital humanists — but ultimately the brother of one of the key figures in digital humanities, often unsung: I worked with Paul Stanwood, a Renaissance literary English professor, and his brother was the person who, at the IBM research labs, developed the first key word in context dynamic index and then gave it back to our community in the late 1950s-1960s, before humanities computing exploding in the sixties and then with the further booms afterwards.

     summary: And so it was mainly to do with concordances and that kind of thing, typical of the early days of humanities computing, but nevertheless, it meant that there was already this long tradition by the time I got to King's in '88, there was already nearly twenty years' tradition of using computers in humanities research.

We gave what I think was the first paper on visualisation in the sort of digital humanities community, there were some people at Waterloo who did visualisation and actually coined the word text visualisation before us but they were computer scientists working on the OED, , they weren't really presenting to the humanities

     summary: With the first wave of digital humanities tools having produced excellent experimental and prototypical work, the fundamental barrier to wider adoption of digital tools seems to lie now in quality interfaces, accessible documentation, and expectations management. Builders must be acutely aware that tool users have not necessarily made any commitment to neither the tool nor the methodology, but are merely exploring research possibilities.

     summary: At the same time, however, the existence of and anxiety over the possibility of forgery — the unauthorized assumption of another person’s identity through his or her writing — call attention to the potential instability and illegitimacy of handwriting, and handwriting’s history is accordingly bound up with the history of competing technological means of authentication. Through these displays of the traces of human hands, then, the multivalent negotiations, frictions, and alliances between technologies and human bodies can come into view.

     summary: Mapping prognostications onto the human body and using body parts to mimetically guide a reader was a common practice in medieval didactic texts. What I proposed in this paper is that instead of examining book history from the print to the digital era, we instead concentrate on the ways in which reading technologies from the pre- and post-print eras anticipate the same sort of reader and share similar reading experiences.

S 1 and S 2 are related by the disjunction of the powerlessness of S 1 to anchor S 2 once and for all: no matter how forcefully S 1 indexes the battery of signifiers (S 2), other signifiers may always be produced.

Among a number of other substantial changes to the copyright law, the new legislation extended the list of works subject to copyright, and included an exclusive right to produce translations in the bundle of rights granted to the owners of copyrights in literary works .

Database copies of newspaper reviews reveal a number of character encoding issues, often replacing the í with an error character similar to □, though most databases recognize both Diaz and Díaz as potential matches for Junot Díaz.

     summary: What separates digital media and practices of digital archiving radically from the spatial organization of the conventional archive (embodied as physical repository) is the so-called time-criticality of digital media, the inescapable temporality that accounts for observations such as Duranti’s about the errant ontology of digital documents. Clearly, then, questions about objects, materiality, and things are once again at the center of a vibrant interdisciplinary conversation, driven in no small measure by the obvious sense in which digital objects can — demonstrably — function as a primary records (in the MLA’s parlance), thereby forcing a confrontation between our established notions of fixity and authenticity and the unique ontologies of data, networks, and computation.

     summary: This essay is published in parallel with a further exploration of the TBT online at http://scalar.usc.edu/nehvectors/border-codes/ where readers will find the complete set of code as well additional interviews, background readings, and analysis. However, rather than merely draw an analogy between the comments and Carroll’s survival poems, I would like to examine the code itself as another channel of poetry and poetic intervention, not because it resembles the structures of traditional verse as is often the case in Perl Poetry or many instances of codework, or poetry that plays upon the semantic structures and conventions of code, but rather because the code represents a text of semantic signs which when performed (either through human or machine reading) intervene in culture by creating a poetic disruption.

     summary: Instead, to better approximate the force of the objects, the digital installation should allow for the relatedness to emerge as primary, as the discerning awareness of individual objects occupying place in relation to a broader context of meaningful activity. We argue that there are important alternative spaces of meaning to be developed between object and audience.

     summary: He maps the origin of computer programming from the 1950s through the 1960s, particularly 1968, when it was decided at a NATO Conference on Software Engineering that programming had come to be perceived as too artistic. From this masculinization of a profession and group of people came the disciplinization of modern computing, where computer programming became a computer science.

     summary: The occurrence of visual elements in VR-environments, digital art and literature, could, with Bolter, Ryan and Grau, be said to deny, or make ekphrasis a redundant concept, By tracing and elucidating a historical trajectory that takes the concept of ekphrasis in the ancient culture as a starting point, the intention is not to reject the theories of the late 1900s, but through a reinterpretation of ekphrasis put forward an example of how digital perspectives on classic concepts could challenge or revise more or less taken-for-granted assumptions in the humanities.

This means that measurable reading time in digital works will share properties with measurable reading time in uncontrolled random access print works.

      flesch: 50
     summary: Concluding remarks Viewed in an optimistic light, Bernhard Rieder and Theo Röhle correctly point out, the great interest among humanities scholars for the digital media looks like the emergence of a new and genuine trans-disciplinarity: Digital humanities - an endeavor at the forefront of crossing boundaries and research traditions - would seem to bridge the gap between the two cultures (Snow 1959), between the quantitative orientation of the natural sciences and critical cultural discourses in the humanities [my emphasis]. When we add to this the sense that many humanities scholars have of competing for funding, recognition and the place of their respective disciplines within higher education, it is easy to understand how DH could become a platform or means for rethinking the humanities and higher education and a way of channeling transformative sentiment that often goes far beyond the digital humanities proper.

A first principles approach to this question is also possible, but due to the mathematical complexity of incorporating OCR errors into calculations finding significant words with log likelihood ratio, we used an empirical approach in this paper.

     summary: Situating our research within the debate between modes of close and distant reading, we focus on what Moretti has identified as the element of literary texts for which modes of distant reading are unable to account, i.e. local narrative voice . Specifically, we chose to pay particular attention to the interrelation of narrative voice and narrative theme, and, within the area of theme, to references to trauma and to cultural context with a view to elucidating not only the text’s generalist and specialist dimensions but, crucially, also their interrelationship.

McGann had the foresight in 2001 to observe that digital technology is a boon to the humanities and the richness of deep narrative reading, warning that the general field of humanities education and scholarship will not take the use of digital technology seriously until one demonstrates how its tools improve the ways we explore and explain aesthetic works .

     summary: The metadata mind turns from the content of an individual text to a network of often very abstract relationships between properties of many texts, and these properties may not be limited to what is traditionally considered to be in the text. Because its metadata are so explicit and consistent across many texts, drama is a genre that lends itself to digital mapping and offers quite precise directions about how to do it.

Although the realness of the scripts is contestable, they highlight the fundamental modality of acceptance that society employs toward printed text as opposed to digital text seen extending from the historical introduction of the printed bank notes, creating a currency of trust .

     summary: To demonstrate a basic area of intersection, I discuss in the next section how the notion of the document in information science can help us think through how epistemologies in literary studies concerning the text are and can be engaged through the development of information systems. Reconsidering this work by using the lens of feminist inquiry to understand the concerns common to information science and digital humanities is the perspective I describe here.

     summary: The Burney Centre contains the world’s largest holdings of material relating to the family of the major eighteenth-century novelist and diarist Frances Burney, which unites microfilm, photocopies, and scans of the major Burney collections at the Berg Collection in the New York Public Library, the British Library in London, and the Beinecke Library at Yale University, as well as important smaller and private holdings. These four examples from manuscripts by Frances Burney, Samuel Richardson, and Lady Wortley Montagu illustrate that this project could be of great interest to eighteenth-century manuscript and textual scholars, as it uses digital methodologies to elucidate manuscripts for editing projects, thus making such projects more accessible than ever before.

     summary: Therefore, Bode is careful to put her own research into context, caveating that no database can hope to capture every scrap of the written word and no analysis can represent the whole truth of publishing history (especially since her corpus was compiled through archiving practices, which select some entries and omit others.) Bode then jumps ahead in history in Nostalgia and the Novel: Looking Back, Looking Forward and examines beliefs surrounding the golden age of Australian publishing (circa the 1970s and 1980s).

     summary: An added value to the vertical alignment of character threads, as opposed to the horizontal arrangement of the xkcd examples, is that the entire script is visible and able to be scrolled alongside the visualization — enabling the integrated close and distant reading noted in the introduction. The challenge of conveying complex information (character appearances, relations with other characters, and absences) as it changes over time — along with our shared interests in the Digital Humanities and our more singular scholarly focuses on cinema and television (Hoyt), visualization and storytelling (Roy), and computational approaches (Ponto) — spurred us to develop a tool that algorithmically analyzes and visualizes screenplays.

     summary: Because the novel has always been an experimental form — insofar as it has always presumed to be new — a renewed interest in experimental print texts has come to express an anxiety about the proliferation of digital texts and digitized distribution models for literature. While there has been a sense that digital texts will long be bookish in design, the reciprocal exchange between media necessitates that print texts are capable of enacting digital characteristics.

In this way, agent-based modeling is closely associated with complex-systems theory, and models are designed to simulate adaptation and emergence.

     summary: Nina B. Huntemann defines feminist game studies as a field that focuses on how gender, and its intersections with race, class, sexuality, etc., is produced, represented, consumed and practiced in and through digital games (2012). Now feminist game scholars organize international conferences, edit journals and scholarly collections, and shape trends in the profession, much as their counterparts in the digital humanities attempt to do, but critics in feminist game studies have been able to take advantage of what is seen as a relatively long trajectory of feminist theoretical inquiry and field development.

In the late twentieth century and early twenty-first century, librarians worked to change their image and the idea of librarianship, both to counter the shush lady stereotype, seen as an impediment to users’ comfort with library services and librarians’ professional status, and to grapple with rapid technological change that restructured the information environment.

     summary: Drawing on the scholarship about the culture of the Wikimedia suite of projects, and the gendered trolling experienced by members of our team in the production of the Social Edition of the Devonshire Manuscript in Wikibooks, and interviews with our advisory group, we argue that while the Wikimedia projects are often openly hostile online spaces, the Wikimedia suite of projects are so important to the contemporary circulation of knowledge, that the key is to encourage gender equity in social behavior, credit sharing, and knowledge organization in Wikimedia, rather than abandon it for a more controlled collaborative environment for edition production and dissemination. Wikibooks proved a challenging environment for edition production for both cultural and technological reasons, reasons which might incline scholars to dispense with the platform.

     summary: It argues and visually demonstrates that materiality is an important topic for comics scholars to consider, and that through creating essays in comics form, comics scholars can develop insights about materiality that are unavailable when analyzing comics by others. By making our own comics, we as comics scholars can learn about the medium from a practical perspective, and these practical insights can inform our theorization of comics.

     summary: It may also prove enlightening to digital humanities faculty in approaching their respective librarians both for support for projects (i.e. using library collections, learning to use metadata, specialized workshops) and as potential collaborators. Whether it is a center, such as the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Center for Digital Research in the Humanities, or smaller, more ambiguous spaces staffed with DH-knowledgeable librarians, academic libraries are becoming inextricably linked with digital humanities research on their respective campuses.

     summary: As Joris van Zundert notes, transformed by digital technology, text and digital editions – digital humanities data in general, as a matter of fact– become fluid, living, reaching a state wherein they are perpetually in a digital information lifecycle . However, instead of viewing his framework as only relevant to social institutions, I adapt it as a broader way to view digital humanities data and scholarship.

     summary: While it was (is) disheartening to imagine that our male colleagues weren’t interested in feminist DH work, it struck us as particularly strange given the history of the field. As suggested by Bianco, Dean, and Clement, a more robust theorization of feminist digital humanities requires understanding the ways in which academic structures subsume feminist innovation and critique, appropriating both the insights and power of subversive work.

      flesch: 52
     summary: If one views Ezekiel 16 through the lens of either of the first two definitions, one can easily make a case for sexual objectification within the text and thus be on firm ground for eliminating the text from one’s canon within the canon, if not the entire bible. Early Jewish communities were wary of including it in their canon of sacred texts because of the chapter’s explicit and disturbing imagery.

In subsequent chapters on lifestreaming and self-branding, Marwick argues that the performative self isn’t just a discrete behavior that people in Silicon Valley adopt while using social media.

     summary: In contrast to existing methods of gender prediction that treat names as if they are timelessly associated with one gender, this method uses a historical approach that takes into account how naming practices change over time. The Genderize.io API is, for example, a more sophisticated implementation of gender prediction than the NLTK algorithm.

      flesch: 35
     summary: By calling attention to the layered materiality of compositions (including the composition of their chapter), Anderson and Sayers negotiate a more complex view of digital compositions and composing practices that may blur disciplinary lines — between, digital humanities, digital rhetoric, media studies, textual studies, and electronic literature, for example , by enabling critical reflection on communicative practice. Citing an increased level of investment in the digital humanities, both within institutions and through external funding agencies, Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson begin their introduction by calling on Matthew Kirschenbaum’s Digital Humanities as/is a Tactical Term to argue that rhetoric and writing studies scholars can leverage DH in two ways: First, we argue that scholars may want to consider selectively redefining digital projects under the umbrella of DH in order to leverage funding, institutional recognition, and extrafield audiences, Second we propose studying the DH job market as an example of how fields in crisis (literary studies and history) are responding to market pressures and, additionally, how rhetoric studies can leverage DH for additional hires.

     summary: In describing this process, our article makes two main contributions: we outline our emergent method for the study of early SF in the context of the Gibson Collection, adapting Franco Moretti’s evolutionary approach to genre, and we demonstrate how integrating information visualization early on in the research process can support exploration and guide the interpretation of vast, largely unknown literary collections. Finally, we identify the benefits and limitations of our approach to early SF as it has developed so far and outline future steps.

     summary: Using this simple and scalable technique on the works of Eliza Haywood, we shall see below, allows one to rapidly identify instances of textual reuse and thereby improve our understanding of the production and dissemination of literary texts in the long eighteenth century. Comparing Haywood’s adaptations to their source passages also helps to reveal one reason why previous editors have had difficulty identifying the sources of her quotations, namely the fact that Haywood often combined lines from disparate literary works into a single passage and then passed the resulting passage off as a quotation of extant works.

     summary: In other words, to critique and comment on sound, DH researchers should work directly with sound — collecting, recording, archiving, curating, and listening to sounds — the premise of this course. Course Goals and Objectives Based on these assumptions, my course, as planned, would assume no previous knowledge of recording and/or editing sound files.

     summary: Variation certainly existed between different almanacs aimed as specific groups of readers, such as farmers or lawyers; however, the genre as a whole was largely unified (and, indeed unifying) in the basic, utilitarian information it provided users about time, geography, tidal shifts, and history. Almanacs contain significant quantities of numbers, symbols, and abbreviations that are inconsistent across different almanacs.

     summary: For those working at larger scales and with higher cumulative levels of uncertainty and error, small networks can function as ground truths against which to test inferences and from which partners may improve network models. We are the first to acknowledge that our network inference procedure comes freighted with assumptions and technical limitations that may pose obstacles to its transferability to other social networks generated from other data sources.

     summary: To begin with, the following paper argues that this is not a genuinely new situation, since all cultural Western history attests to written texts as never having been autonomous from oral discourses and versioning steps. His opinion reminds one of the famous Platonian passage in the Phaedrus regarding the written discourse that drifts all over the place [...and is] unable to defend or help itself; Plato posits that speech is superior to written text, since the former is: written with intelligence in the mind of the learner (Plato, Phaedrus 275e and 276a, ).

     summary: In order to further explore the relationship between theory and practice within DH models of modeling, it will be important to develop appropriate ad hoc guiding frameworks (based on case studies designed around the needs of specific contexts of modelling). In a pragmatic understanding of model building theory and object are complementary; the model takes a middle position operating within a middle-out approach.

     summary: To make the case for the value of data mining in literary study, Macroanalysis is divided into three sections: Revolution differentiates data mining from close-reading, the method he argues has come to dominate literary studies; Evidence contrasts the kind of evidentiary material data mining produces to the kind derived from a close, careful reading of a text by an individual analyst; Analysis examines data mining in relation to the history of humanities computing as a way of differentiating it from other forms of computational and/or digital approaches; and Prospects briefly discusses some of the issues and questions the methodology of macroanalysis seems particularly well-suited to address, especially in contrast to close-reading.

     summary: Yet as mobile research grew and expanded, particularly in the smartphone era, it began to raise other kinds of questions. Action Research as a base Unlike in the early days of mobile research, scholars in the field today no longer have to lock themselves into the stereotype of wearing white lab coats, carrying around clipboards and staring at people through one-way glass.

     summary: However, given that animals use a variety of senses to achieve path integration (inertial cues, proprioception, motor efference, optic flow, and sensitivity to the earth’s magnetic field), and given that social network activity occurs in a complex system, any practical attempt to evaluate trend integration would require additional development in the tools and techniques for studying social network trends. Through a study of trend data mined from Twitter, this article suggests the possibility of identifying a virality threshold for Twitter trends, and the possibility that such a threshold has broader implications for attention ecology research in the digital humanities.

     summary: The anthropological value of summed film frames speaks very clearly to the contemporary challenges of using a digital humanities approach towards film and media studies: this project is in palpable ways a product of my history as a film obsessive, my situation as a developing scholar in a new field, my freedom to acquire and manipulate digital film, and the constant resistance I experience over the value of this project in its ability to contribute to the scholarly field. This article describes one such method using the z-projection function of the scientific image analysis software ImageJ to sum film frames in order to create new composite images.

     summary: No, because if we look at DIY culture we will see that there most likely will continue to be many cultural productions of non-digital material, which humanities researchers must continue to study and understand.

     summary: Casti presents a framework approach to creating one’s own complex systems for research purposes, and enduringly fosters in his reader an appreciation of the fundamentals: how such systems behave, what the best practices are, and how best to think about complex systems. This allows the text to serve as more than just a simulation how-to guide; instead, it gives the patient reader the necessary background and analytic tools for assessing complex systems and implementing them, for whatever purpose, to their maximum efficiency.

     summary: Drawing on the experience of the Pliny project, and recent work done within that project to explore how Pliny materials might connect with the semantic web, we explore ways in which structured graph-like thinking might be revealed in — to peek out from — parts of humanities research that is common to digital and non-digital humanists alike. Underlying the representation of Pliny materials in RDF is a rudimentary ontology of Pliny's objects.

     summary: Therefore, we think that modern methods of process representation could contribute to highlight the interactions between these various elements and, as such, that they would give a relevant description of past collective enterprises like, for example, the production of knowledge. The method of process representation that we consider here is inscribed in an overall toolbox usually declined in five phases of which the main and key objective is to converge to a zero-defect approach in a chain of production.

     summary: What Patterson shares with the writers of Mills and Boon novels, the forgotten eighteenth-century hack pieces, and the dime novels and penny dreadfuls of the nineteenth-century, is that he writes simple, populistic works with no pretensions of academic literary quality, designed to sell. By understanding the pervading social forces of occidental late capitalism, and by anticipating the nature of everyday human experience within this network of systems, Patterson produces novels which have the phantasms of modern life inscribed upon their pages, and the fractured reality of modern experience carved out as their form.

     summary: The methodology and the preliminary results of a research project that aims at a draft reconstruction of ancient Nubia based on the The William J. Bankes Archive William J. Bankes (1786-1855), an Englishman with conspicuous financial means and a voracious appetite for antiquities, travelled throughout Egypt and the Near East in the years 1815-1819 . In this article, the use of the term Bankes Archive, in fact, includes all the documents that were produced during the expeditions funded by Bankes, but that are held in different institutions and in different countries.

     summary: The quantity of a topic's overall significance can easily be computed as a relative measure using the model outcome of topic models: topic-significance k = (∑ d θ dk · N d)/(∑ d N d), where θ dk is the d-th document's topic proportion of topic k, satisfying θ dk ≤ 0, k=1,..., K and Exploration Task 3 - Finding Different Polysemous and Homonymic Semantics of Terms One advantage of topic models is the automatic disambiguation of semantic meanings of words into topics.

     summary: Also, we didn’t have a training dataset, as often happens in other cases of translation alignment, since there was no existing corpus of aligned Homeric Greek - French texts. However popular Greek studies might have been during the second half of the 19th century, their descent is quite tangible throughout the 20th, and so is a drop in interest for literary Greek translation, especially in the first twenty years of the century.

     summary: We suggest that such professors look for projects with a Contribute link and/or Contributor Guidelines, an irregular publication cycle (i.e., one not locked into Issues or Releases), a variety of roles that students can perform, evidence of past student contributions (although this evidence is not essential, since a project may never have thought of mobilizing student scholarship), and, of course, a digital presence. The biggest impediment to publishing student work is time–time spent on peer review, copyediting, and the additional demands of encoding.

     summary: The idea of crosswalking and aligning these elements is to stress how an information literacy-focused approach to working with digital sources and tools transcends demonstration and is instead anchored firmly in library and disciplinary-oriented teaching and learning. The integration of digital skills in the liberal arts course is an opportunity to promote the continued strength of a skilled, literate, critical culture.

     summary: Whereas wholly online courses are usually governed by contracts that state which party (university or instructor) has copyright and responsibility for the material, courses like the one I just outlined are exercises in guerilla pedagogy and the ownership of copyright is not wholly clear. In effect, the closed digital architecture of universities, combined with the increasing reliance on sessional instructors to deliver course material, is further reinforcing the divide between tenure-track and non-TT faculty.

The EEBO-TCP collection does not lend itself to computer-based analysis without a great deal of labour-intensive preparation and re-organization, primarily because of two distinct sets of problems: a) the relative inflexibility in the EEBO interface (see http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebogroup/), which functions very well as a finding aid, but is a poor mechanism for compiling subsets of full texts; and b) orthographic irregularity.

     summary: Humanities students need digital literacy skills–including the women who make up the majority of such students and potentially face gender biases related to digital technology and computing culture–and DH tools and methods are well-oriented toward the development of these skills within the context of the humanities. In light of the trend of increasing numbers of women entering higher education and choosing humanities and arts degrees, DH can also help women who potentially face gender biases related to digital technology gain competence and confidence with it through their humanities courses.

As I and my collaborators undertake to re-engineer and revitalize the London Stage Information Bank, we are mindful of the obvious lessons in preservation and sustainability offered by the history sketched out above; any new version of the database will need to adhere to current best practices for sustainability, developed in consultation with librarians and archivists who have expertise in this area.

     summary: As instructors, we can play an important role in ensuring that they get a critical vocabulary for thinking about the intersections between media, language and culture and they interact with literary texts meaningfully. Yuri Lotman, in his groundbreaking work on a semiotic theory of culture, finds the language of literary texts to be the best vehicle for identifying specific semiotic codes prevalent among different social groups in different historical periods.

     summary: Inspired by the museums of conscience idea , which argues that museums offer a space for education and justice, I contend that improving database search functionality through heavy editing–metadata that is voluminous, polyvocal, and critical–is at present the best means for facilitating digital image archives to contribute to this increasingly significant socio-political project. This article assesses some examples of digital image archives to consider what a socially responsible archival practice might look like.

     summary: For example, expert users have been found to like more complex graph-based search approaches, whereas casual users prefer simple search methods such as a controlled natural language approach, which experts find too restrictive . Thorough user evaluations with expert users still need to be carried out to investigate the usability of both interfaces, similar to what was done with the interfaces we designed for casual users, as discussed in the next sections.

     summary: The idea behind entity linking is that knowledge bases can be leveraged to perform a full disambiguation of entities through URIs. It gained worldwide attention in 2010 when an evaluation campaign showed that it outperformed other state-of-the-art systems for entity disambiguation, See this blog post for a detailed report on the Entity Extraction & Content API Evaluation: http://blog.viewchange.org/2010/05/entity-extraction-content-api-evaluation/. an assessment confirmed by later studies .

     summary: In the light of this, applying computer methods to the humanities can help us to be more humanistic than before because it leads us, first, to an inner journey through rational paths triggered by language expression. With respect to this question, Busa's message is that the development of an informed theory of the making of technology cannot elude a renewed, unremitting consideration of language features and issues, which, in a kind of virtuous circle, are positively related to the effects of technology on our life.

     summary: The first is simple: there is always something to learn from prior practice, and no shift in the technological apparatus of Digital Humanities research is likely to be so great a rupture that all prior work is rendered irrelevant. Drawing on recent DH work and publications that engage with questions of DH collaboration in different ways (e.g. ), we analyse three types of DH collaboration: 1) human-human interactions; 2) human-machine/material interactions; and 3) machine/material-machine/material interactions.

     summary: By examining, dismantling, and reimagining digital interfaces and their aims, we can stress the ways that natural or intuitive design methodologies rely heavily on false (and often white, North American, and economically privileged) assumptions about the realities of many users. The Tyranny of Uncertainty Emerson notes that the rhetoric touting the magic of twenty-first century devices, invisible interfaces, and ubiquitous computing initiatives might not be so disagreeable if it didn’t also help determine the shape of the future of computing .

     summary: When developing our own assessment rubric and examining student work for this study, then, we sought to evaluate student learning, but for the purposes of understanding the effectiveness of our pedagogy rather than to assign a grade. While discussions of assessment of DH classroom projects generally focus on the question of how to grade student work, we argue that assessment is as important for reflecting on and evaluating pedagogy, including how to balance and iteratively improve scaffolding and play approaches.

       words: 2236
      flesch: 40
     summary: Almost twenty years after the first excited manifestos for cognitive literary studies, Ciccoricco’s book soberly demonstrates that literary studies need not necessarily aim to run alongside the cutting-edge of cognitive science, but it has to at least be responsibly current . Cognitive literary studies has become increasingly established as a discipline, its rise marked by landmark studies such as Lisa Zunshine’s Why We Read Fiction: Theory of Mind and the Novel (2006) and Alan Richardson’s British Romanticism and the Science of Mind (2001).

       words: 8116
      flesch: 50
     summary: A clearer and more systematic handling of the complex relations among Blake’s art is just one of the many improvements that a redesigned Blake Archive will offer. Since a work like the Marriage does not exist as an abstract, Platonic ideal, but is only physically manifested in the twelve extant copies that Blake printed between 1790 and his death in 1827 (three of which consist of only three or four of the twenty-seven total plates), As former Blake Archive Project Manager Ashley Reed puts it, the Archive’s most basic ontological units are the work, the copy, and the object: art-historical terms that, in the case of Blake’s work, exist on a kind of sliding scale from the theoretical to the material .

     summary: Still, the difference between bot users and regular users is of course that instead of interacting with a team via one of Slack’s apps, bot users are controlled programmatically via a bot user token. The first round of bot experiments played Fru Kost, the second round played Abba, and the third round played Abba again — but with increasing multiple bots at the same time.

     summary: As we heard repeatedly at the workshop, no one can do it alone; Collaborative scholarly workflows (e.g., functionality and workflows that enable in digital space the scholarly workshop model of multiple scholars working together on one manuscript) and similar workflows for citizen science, knowledge-sourcing, or crowd-sourcing initiatives; Pedagogical workflows for use with students and citizen scientists; Ability to access manuscript images from multiple digital repositories and use digital tools on them (i.e., a client application model); Integration of text and image data — as one can see in Figure 3, over 65 percent of respondents indicated they need to be able to work with both manuscript text and image data in their work; Response to survey question #10 regarding whether the manuscript text, image, or both is the primary focus of the respondent in their work. These insights and recommendations emerged from a collective effort of scholars, curators, and technologists to survey the state of digital tools available for manuscript study and curation.

     summary: Analysis of input actions or completion of search tasks on their own, while key components in understanding the cybernetic assemblage, do not tell the whole story of how — in Barad’s and Drucker’s terms — a human intra-acting with the distributed machinic components is made discursively meaningful. Our study design admittedly prioritized specific search tasks in order to target use of specific features as well as to allow easy comparison to search tasks in Google.

     summary: In wondering this, he is pre-figuring his own argument linking the development of new computational methods for literary analysis to new forms of literary understanding, that the possibilities offered by computerization toward the re-imagination of the shape of literary works might influence our appreciation of what literature is. For works of ambient literature, this movement moves in the opposite direction, but is the same move: new works of computationally derived literatures require new modes of reading.

The industrial plan shows in the details: the skylights, the power cables dropped from the ceiling alongside columns, the rows of small heaters with chimney pipes, even the open spaces around the edge of the room for worktables, where textual piecework could be done offline (punched-card sorting and concordance lemmatization), as well as the prominent station in a room to the side of the main lab space with a desk for Father Busa—a kind of manager’s office.

     summary: Revisions of medieval fables also incorporated commentaries within their elaborations on the Aesopic imagination, but the result was hardly parodic and the previous fables were rarely victims of critique. Aesopic fables and commentary, as they appear within particular manuscripts and printed books, operate as orchestrated compilations, which both recognize and challenge its predecessors, inviting future readers to do the same.

     summary: Making space for boredom gives us a way to forestall and frame our urge for digital distractions without pretending like it's possible or even desirable ever to be fully beyond their reach. While the collectivizing effects of cinematic distraction have evolved into a much more atomized experience of scattered attention with digital media, the essential crowding out of boredom by broadcast radio finds an analogue in the way we look to our screens today.

The simple XSLT transformations used to visualise PML data could also be used as the basis of interactive web-based services for presenting parliamentary data for non-specialist users.

     summary: The project aims to reassemble in a virtual, open-access environment one of Renaissance Italy’s most stunning courtly art collections, the studiolo of Isabella d’Este (1474-1539), marchesa of the city-state of Mantua. As a complex, IDEA provides resources for the study of the Italian Renaissance through the figure of one of its most distinguished and celebrated women, Isabella d’Este.

     summary: Across the humanities disciplines that have integrated computational modes of analysis, data visualization (or information visualization) is an increasingly dominant force, and as such it carries with it the requisite challenges that accompany any new medium or discourse of analysis employed in humanistic scholarship and teaching. In the Northeastern University Library, where support services are available to researchers in the campus community around information visualization and design, these basic concepts are taught and discussed through critical dichotomies that can help guide our thinking about specific design choices we make in the creative process of data visualization ( Figure 1).

     summary: Therefore, infoVis designers should not only know the practical meanings of the visual parameters defined in the science field, but also understand how the language of visual design can improve the aesthetic and functional quality. Therefore, infoVis researchers and practitioners also need to be educated about the impact of choices in design elements and styles – which are usually taught in the field of art and design.

     summary: Despite these problems, in the last two decades, studies that investigate the relationship between image use and learning have increased and this led to the development of an initial survey of the state of the art that can help practitioners to be more aware of the function that image consumption performs in the more general cognitive process of individuals. In particular, an average increase of 11,2% was obtained for the indicator of metacognition.

     summary: GLAMs might, for example, spend more time nurturing public engagement projects and ingesting the products of crowdsourcing and other kinds of engagement projects into CMSs (content management systems), rather than having specialists add deeper metadata to a lightly catalogued collection. Crowdsourcing Our Cultural Heritage is an important collection for anyone working in cultural heritage or academia who is interested in the pros and cons of implementing crowdsourcing projects, whether for manuscript transcription, image or video tagging or crowd-curated exhibitions.

     summary: By developing open approaches to the development of archiving and sustainability frameworks, even if they are merely the least bad option , the digital humanities community might aspire to deliver on the promise of earlier initiatives like the Arts & Humanities Data Service and safeguard the future of both the community and public investment in digital research projects. If digital humanities projects become known for not only soaking up valuable money that could be used in other disciplines, but using that money on unsustainable projects, the central raison d'être of the wider tradition - using digital tools and methods to answer research questions in the humanities - will be undermined.

     summary: Despite a growing interest in text visualization among literary scholars, so far, narrative visualizations are not designed to support the particular tasks involved in narratological analysis and often fail to reveal nuanced narratological features.

An abundance of virtual world projects in archaeology, history, and heritage-related subjects have been created, especially since the 2000s, particularly during the years that Second Life and Open Simulator were at their peak.

     summary: Together, the Symposium on Invisible Work in Digital Humanities and this special issue make the case that: care is a first, essential collaborative tool; scales of credit and recognition are varied and variable for every individual connected to the work; the documentary impulse is a useful method for beginning to make labor legible; acknowledging a spectrum of works (e.g., volunteer efforts, workflows, and community development) offers an expansive understanding of scholarly activity; and the inherent paradoxes of DH work, often simultaneously collaborative and singly-authored, are a great strength, if also a great challenge. Thus, we take as a starting point the assertion that DH work is first and foremost work in the humanistic tradition — the selfsame tradition that may enable us to resist being defined by what we are not.

     summary: Failing to circulate digital work beyond a small handful of faculty members at a specific university would severely undermine the on-going critical contributions of digital projects and their authors, seeing as the scholarly or pedagogical value of many interactive texts resides in their capacity to be actively used by other individuals. This examination proposes that a revised understanding of access can be a useful framework for revealing, critiquing, and even modifying the oft-invisible boundaries separating university and non-university technology policies or infrastructures, boundaries that might unintentionally stymie the inventive potential of collaborative, interactive digital projects.

     summary: Using DIAS and DENDRON, computer applications designed for the study of infectious fungi and cancer cells, we forge a connection in color, composition, and theme between Paolo Veronese’s Les Noces de Cana and Paul Cézanne’s Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux. A computer-assisted comparison using the newly developed DIAS/DENDRON ART (DDA) software of fifty-five oil paintings by Paul Cézanne, exhibited at the Galerie Vollard, Paris, in 1895, suggests that Cézanne’s Baigneuse debout, s’essuyant les cheveux, is highly related to Veronese’s Les Noces de Cana, in color, saturation, brightness, and complexity (Figures 2-4).

     summary: But to ask such questions is to exclude, to return to Risam’s phrasing, the many earlier, oft­unrecognized instances of digital humanities work that [engage] with difference. In this way, DH activism can form a necessary bridge between the lingering theory and practice divide of digital humanities.

     summary: This brief account of feminist book history scholarship falls short of the breadth and depth of the field, as it is largely limited to women and print in early modern England and the United States, the area where we primarily focus and which the sources in the WBHB database best represent. In book history scholarship, to tell the story by women is to position it as the story of women.

     summary: By drawing out these paradoxes, the user is always aware of the constructedness of media narratives while also recognizing their role in following (or challenging) the rules of the game. is not necessarily to represent the shooting in a realistic way, but rather make explicit one’s position as media user within a culture steeped in violence and in turn acknowledge responsibility…for the real-world violence that happened that day .

       title: A Model of Versions and Layers

     summary: The move is, of course, counter-intuitive since these document-wide layers were not intended by the author as texts to be read. If produced by a machine, such as a printing press, text presents itself for encoding as a sequence of characters arranged into evenly spaced lines contained in one or more columns per page.

       title: Manual Annotation of Unsupervised Models: Close and Distant Reading of Politics on Reddit
        date: 2019-10-21
       words: 9536
      flesch: 55
     summary: The analysis of the close and distant reading demonstrates that LDA is indeed a possibility to generate a computational model of close reading annotations. Still, there are many questions on the close reading side, leading to different collections of close reading classes and we need to determine which of those correspond to the identified distant reading classes.
