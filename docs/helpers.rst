Helpers
=======

This is a fledgling list of helper applications/scripts used in conjunction with the Toolbox. Your milage will vary:

  1. folder2metadata_ - Given a directory, output a CSV file suitable for the Reader
  2. htid2books_ - Given an access key, secret token, and a HathiTrust identifier, output plain text as well as PDF versions of a book.
  3. mbox2reader_ - Given a few configurations, read an mbox file, and output a file system amenable to the Reader
  4. txt2chapters_ - Given a plain text file delimited by a patter, output "DIRECTORY"
